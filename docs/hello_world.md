# Hello, World!

Rust files **always end** with the .rs extension 
and should use snake_case.

To compiler and run, we should:

```
rustc main.rs && ./main
```

- rustc is used to compiler the code
- rustfmt is used to format the code

Like C, Rust has a main function, that is always the first code that runs
in every executable Rust program.
